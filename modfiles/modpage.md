# Fluidic Power

This mod changes the power network to use the game's in-built fluid system in an attempt to make electricity more realistic. This makes it possible to add working transformers for high power transmission, and all new and interresting power distribution challenges.

More realistic power distribution has been requested from players for years. Essentially, you shouldn't be able to power you entire factory thorugh a single small power pole. However, the developers decided not to implement this for simplicity and performance reasons. There are outdated mods that have attempted this as well. For example [Flow Network](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Simdezimon/flownetwork) from Factorio 0.13 and [High Voltage](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/JeroenDStout/highvoltage) for Factorio 0.15. However, both these mods had a massive impact on UPS since they manually calculated the power transmission between poles every game tick. What sets `Fluidic Power` apart is that it utilizes the game's built-in fluid system to simulate the transmission of power between poles. No on tick power calculations are done.
