Version: 0.3.0
Date: ??. 03. 2021
  Changes:
    - Improved fluidbox connections for increased power flow. Perfect alignment now necessary.
    - Reduced fluid units to 10kJ, 1MJ, and 100MJ to reduce internal pole buffer.
    - Much nicer icons. (Still WIP though).
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed overlay not drawing all connections.
    - Fixed likely multiplayer bugs.
    - Fixed Accumulator and Energy Sensor circuit connections.
    - Fixed cases where fluids could be mixed accidentally.

Version: 0.2.0
Date: 06. 03. 2021
  Changes:
    - Removed side inputs of transformers.
    - Accumulators now only accepts low voltages (10kJ fluid units) as it should have.
    - Power switch power transfer limit now 50MW of 50GW depending on voltage.
    - Halved internal energy buffer of big poles.
  Bugfixes:
    - Power units now actually available as signals for circuit network.
    - Upgrade planner now works on small poles. (Upgrade filters still wonky)
    - Fixed transformer output distance being too long.
